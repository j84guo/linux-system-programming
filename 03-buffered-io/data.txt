WHEN PAPA AND MARTY FIRST RENTED in 1940 the Finca
Vig√≠a which was to be his home for the next twenty-two years until his death, there was still a real
country on the south side. This country no longer exists. It was not done in by middle-class real estate
developers like Chekhov's cherry orchard, which might have been its fate in Puerto Rico or Cuba
without the Castro revolution, but by the startling growth of the population of poor people and their
shack housing which is such a feature of all the Greater Antilles, no matter what their political
persuasion.
